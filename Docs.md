# Why FPS Matters in Gaming

## The Fundamentals of FPS

Frames Per Second (FPS) is the measurement of how many unique consecutive images a game can render each second. This metric is crucial because:

- **Human Perception**: The average human can perceive differences up to about 150-200 FPS
- **Motion Smoothness**: Higher FPS results in smoother animations and transitions
- **Input Latency**: More frames mean lower delay between player input and on-screen response

## Competitive Advantages

| FPS Range | Gaming Experience |
|-----------|-------------------|
| <30 FPS | Noticeable stuttering, poor gameplay |
| 30-45 FPS | Playable but not ideal |
| 45-60 FPS | Smooth casual gaming |
| 60-144 FPS | Competitive gaming standard |
| 144+ FPS | Professional esports level |

## Psychological Impact

Studies show that higher FPS:
- Reduces eye strain during extended play sessions
- Improves player performance in fast-paced games
- Creates a more immersive experience

# FPS Optimization Guide

## Hardware Considerations

### GPU Settings
- Update graphics drivers regularly
- Adjust fan curves for better thermal performance
- Consider overclocking (with proper cooling)

### CPU Optimization
- Close background applications
- Set high-performance power plan
- Consider core affinity for some games

## In-Game Settings

### Most Impactful Settings
1. **Resolution**: Lowering gives biggest FPS boost
2. **Shadows**: High/Ultra shadows are very demanding
3. **Anti-Aliasing**: MSAA/TAA are performance-heavy
4. **View Distance**: Affects CPU workload significantly

### Recommended Settings for 60+ FPS

| Setting | Competitive | Balanced | Visual Quality |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Texture Quality | Medium | High | Ultra |
| Shadows | Low | Medium | High |
| Effects | Low | Medium | High |
| Post-Processing | Off | Medium | High |

# FPS Benchmarking Guide

## Methodology

1. Use consistent test scenarios
2. Measure average, 1% lows, and 0.1% lows
3. Run multiple passes for accuracy
4. Control for background processes

## Benchmark Tools

### Free Options
- FRAPS (old but reliable)
- MSI Afterburner with RivaTuner
- PresentMon (DX12/Vulkan)

### Professional Tools
- NVIDIA FrameView
- OCAT (Open Capture and Analysis Tool)
- Built-in game benchmarks

## Interpreting Results

- **Average FPS**: Overall performance
- **1% lows**: Indicates stuttering
- **Frametime consistency**: Smoothness indicator

> Example Benchmark Result:
> ```
> Game: Cyberpunk 2077 @ 1440p
> Avg FPS: 72.4
> 1% Low: 48.2
> 0.1% Low: 41.7
> ```
