### DNS Optimization
ðŸ”§ **Why Change Your DNS?**  
The default DNS from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) often:
- Has slow response times
- Lacks proper caching
- May log your browsing data

ðŸš€ **Recommended DNS Providers**:
| Provider | Primary DNS | Secondary DNS | Best For |
|----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Cloudflare | 1.1.1.1 | 1.0.0.1 | Fastest global response |
| Google | 8.8.8.8 | 8.8.4.4 | Reliability |
| OpenDNS | 208.67.222.222 | 208.67.220.220 | Security filtering |

### How to Change DNS
#### **Router-Level (Recommended)**
1. Access your router admin page (usually `192.168.1.1`)
2. Navigate to WAN/DNS settings
3. Replace ISP DNS with preferred addresses
4. Reboot router

*âœ… Benefits:*
- Applies to all connected devices
- No per-device configuration needed
- Improves all network traffic
